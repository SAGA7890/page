     “Many times in his writings, particularly in The Synthesis of Yoga, Sri Aurobindo warns us against the imaginings of those who believe they can do sadhana without rigorous self-control and who heed all sorts of inspirations, which lead them to a dangerous imbalance where all their repressed, hidden, secret desires come out into the open under the pretence of liberation from ordinary conventions and ordinary reason.”²⁶
​The Mother
Concentration is defined as ‘the bringing to its full intensity and the mastered and self-directed employment of that energy of being in us for a definite end.’¹ To renounce all types of earthly enjoyments is the general cause of increase of concentration power, samyama. The purpose and necessity of Concentration is to trace the cycle of self-oblivion and self-discovery in Ignorance and Knowledge for the joy of Nature and Spirit. Exclusive concentration is the frontal pragmatic power of concentration in a limited superficial surface working of the all-inclusive Integral Concentration; it is much like that power of our human mentality which is absorbed in a particular object and in a particular work and seems to use so much part knowledge and partial ideas that are necessary for it by forgetting his totality or rest of himself. But it is all the time a part and portion of an indivisible concentration in us that has done all the work that has to be done and seen all thing that has to be seen. This ability of exclusive concentration is rightly held to be one of the greatest powers of the human mind and it is only a supreme self-possessing Knowledge which can thus be powerful to limit itself in the act and yet work out perfectly all its intentions through that apparent Ignorance.​​​​​
​
If intellect is purified, then a student of integral Education or a Sadhaka of integral Yoga can practice self-control. This self-control will be spontaneous and rigorous if his Psychic being in the heart or the Spiritual Being above the head opens. In integral Concentration, his self-control will be spontaneously absolute.⁴³
​
a) Education through first Exclusive Concentration:
​
“Then science and reason careless of the soul
Could iron out a tranquil uniform world,
Aeonic seekings glut with outward truths
And a single-patterned thinking force on mind,
Inflicting Matter’s logic on Spirit’s dreams
A reasonable animal make of man
And a symmetrical fabric of his life.” Savitri-255
​
“Ideals, systems, sciences, poems, crafts
Tirelessly there perished and again recurred,
Sought restlessly by some creative Power;
But all were dreams crossing an empty vast.” Savitri-642
​
“The mind is a thing that dwells in diffusion, in succession; it can only concentrate on one thing at a time and when not concentrated runs from one thing to another very much at random. Therefore it has to concentrate on a single idea, a single subject of meditation, a single object of contemplation, a single object of will in order to possess or master it, and this it must do to at least the temporary exclusion of all others.”³¹
​Sri Aurobindo
“The first step in concentration must be always to accustom the discursive mind to a settled unwavering pursuit of a single course of connected thought on a single subject and this it must do undistracted by all lures and alien calls on its attention. Such concentration is common enough in our ordinary life, but it becomes more difficult when we have to do it inwardly without any outward object or action on which to keep the mind; yet this inward concentration is what the seeker of knowledge must effect.”³²
​Sri Aurobindo
“Studies strengthen the mind and turn its concentration away from the impulses and desires of the vital. Concentrating on study is one of the most powerful ways of controlling the mind and the vital; that is why it is so important to study.”³³
​​The Mother
The first immediate approach towards the realisation of the slow pace of Education in the active mind¹⁵ is the development of (first) exclusive concentration, one form of the self-gathering of the power of Tapas,¹⁸ which is defined as the complete absorption in the objective world by an entire separation¹² from the true Self; this practical self-oblivion without essential and binding self-ignorance is the nature of exclusive concentration; out of this concentration, the secret of the material world is revealed, in recent times it has justified itself by the many immense and innumerable minute discoveries of Modern Science.²⁴ The limitation of this first exclusive concentration is that it erects a wall of exclusion limiting itself to a single field, domain, or habitation in the movement so that it is aware only of that and unaware of all the rest. Thus, a principle of self-limiting knowledge has emerged which culminates in a positive and effective potential Education which manifests as the genius of an artist, Scientist, Sportsman, Administrator, Educationist. They are identified as the elite of the society. A seeker of Truth utilises the faculty of first exclusive concentration towards calling down the spaceless Infinity to the limited space of his surrounding world and self-expansion in the form of manifestation of objective Divine Work with the aid of three gunas.
​
b) Education through Second Exclusive Concentration:
​
“Its solitude greatened her human hours” Savitri-14
​
“At last the traveller in the paths of Time
Arrives on the frontiers of eternity.” Savitri-23
​
“Absorbed no more in the moment-ridden flux
Where mind incessantly drifts as on a raft
Hurried from phenomenon to phenomenon,
He abode at rest in indivisible Time.
As if a story long written but acted now,
In his present he held his future and his past,
Felt in the seconds the uncounted years
And saw the hours like dots upon a page.” Savitri-33
​
“Inheritor of the brief animal mind,
Man, still a child in Nature’s mighty hands
In the succession of the moments lives;
To a changing present is his narrow right;
His memory stares back at phantom past,
The future flees before him as he moves;
He sees imagined garments, not a face.” Savitri-53
​
“It leaves two giant letters void of sense
While without sanction turns the middle sign
Carrying an enigmatic universe,
As if a present without future or past
Repeating the same revolution’s whirl
Turned on its axis in its own Inane.” Savitri-56
​
“It (Overmind) can immortalise a moment's work:” Savitri-85,
​
“Absorbed in the present act, the fleeting days,
None thought to look beyond the hour’s gains,
Or dreamed to make this earth a fairer world,
Or felt some touch divine surprise his heart.” Savitri-145
“It (Spiritual Being) sees the hurrying crowd of moments stream
Towards the still greatness of a distant hour." (Timeless state) Savitri-160
​
“His little hour is spent in little things…
Time has he none to turn his eyes within
And look for his lost self and his dead soul.” Savitri-164-65
​
“She hopes by the creative act’s release
To o’erleap sometimes the gulf she cannot fill
To heal awhile the wound of severance,
Escape from the moment’s prison of littleness
And meet the Eternal’s wide sublimities
In the uncertain time-field portioned here.
Almost she nears what never can be attained;
She shuts eternity into an hour
And fills a little soul with the Infinite;
The Immobile leans to the magic of her call;
She stands on a shore in the Illimitable,
Perceives the formless Dweller in all forms
And feels around her infinity’s embrace.” Savitri-177
​
“She has lured the Eternal into arms of Time.” Savitri-178
​
“But now she turns to break the oblivious spell,
Awakes the sleeper on the sculptured couch;
She finds again the Presence in the form
And in the light that wakes with him recovers
A meaning in the hurry and trudge of Time,
And through this mind that once obscured the soul
Passes a glint of unseen deity.” Savitri-182
​
“No silent peak is found where Time can rest.” Savitri-197
​
"A touch supreme surprised his hurrying heart," Savitri-237
​
“Labours for the hour and not for eternity
And trades its gains to meet the moment’s call:” Savitri-240
​
“Two firmaments of darkness and of light
Opposed their limits to the spirit’s walk;
It moved veiled in from Self’s infinity
In a world of beings and momentary events
Where all must die to live and live to die.” Savitri-287-288
​
“Attracting into time the timeless Light,
Imprisoning eternity in the hours,
This they (bright gods of Thought) have planned, to snare the feet of Truth
In an aureate net of concept and of phrase
And keep her captive for the thinker’s joy
In his little world built of immortal dreams:” Savitri-274
​
“The moments there were pregnant with all time.” Savitri-301
​
“The moment’s thought inspired the passing act.” Savitri-325,
​​
“A marriage with eternity divinised Time.” Savitri-327
​
“His day is a moment in perpetual Time;
He is the prey of the minutes and the hours.” Savitri-336
​
“Immortal movements touched the fleeting hours.” Savitri-352
​
“Each minute was a throb of beauty’s heart;
The hours were tuned to a sweet-toned content” Savitri-355
​
“That a diviner Force might enter life,
A breath of Godhead greaten human time.” Savitri-366
​
“A moment passed that was eternity’s ray,
An hour began, the matrix of new Time.” Savitri-399
​
“In the immutable ideal world
One human moment was eternal made.” Savitri-411
​
“This now remained with her, her heart’s constant scene.” Savitri-412
​
“In his floating house upon the sea of Time
The regent sits at work and never rests:
He is a puppet of the dance of Time;
He is driven by the hours, the moment’s call
Compels him with the thronging of life’s need
And the babel of the voices of the world.” Savitri-478
​
“The hurried servant senses answer apace
To every knock upon the outer doors,
Bring in time’s visitors, report each call,
Admit the thousand queries and the calls
And the messages of communicating minds
And the heavy business of unnumbered lives
And all the thousandfold commerce of the world.” Savitri-478-79
​
“A portion of us lives in present Time,
A secret mass in dim inconscience gropes;
Out of the inconscient and subliminal
Arisen, we live in mind’s uncertain light
And strive to know and master a dubious world
Whose purpose and meaning are hidden from our sight.” Savitri-484
​
(Savitri said) “All means are held good to catch a single beam,
Eternity sacrificed for a moment’s bliss:
Yet for joy and not for sorrow earth was made
And not as a dream in endless suffering Time.” Savitri-629
​
(Death said) “Hope not to call God down into his life.
How shalt thou (Savitri) bring the Everlasting here?
There is no house for him in hurrying Time” Savitri-644
​
“I (Savitri) claim from Time my will’s eternity,
God from his moments.” Savitri-652
​
“And love and joy overtake fleeing Time.” Savitri-664
The second exclusive concentration¹⁹ is a contemplation on the present without past and future. Then there is development of second exclusive concentration, which is defined as to preoccupy and limit oneself with the mental knowledge of the present which is hurriedly changing from moment to moment in a helpless succession of events, forms, phenomena and actions, oblivious of the successive past and future happenings except that of memory that holds little and vague inference of future; through this concentration, the objective experience of the ever-changing present environment is realised through a superficial movement of consciousness; thus, the man is practically and dynamically the man of moments; future is withheld from his possession; identifies himself solely in the name and personality of the present narrow existence, lives only in his immediate and outward work and problem and ignorant of his limitation of past births and Spirit’s unending future or put aside the whole infinite course of Time and his rest of total Self and Nature. Yet all the time this existence in the present moment is not the real or the whole truth of his being, but only a practical or pragmatic mental construction for the purposes of the superficial movement of his life and within its limits and he recovers partially from this restriction by linking together the succession of moments, the succession of points of Space, the successions of forms and movements in Time and Space which are beyond his control and comprehension. This second exclusive concentration is 'ignorant but capable of seeking for knowledge and finding it at least in a series of mental representations which may be made clues to the true truth and, more and more refined and illuminated and rendered transparent by the influence, the infiltration and the descent of the light from above, prepare the intelligence for opening to the capacity of true knowledge.'⁴⁵ The superficial or the apparent man can dissolve this partial concentration of living from moment to moment and go back from its present action at any time to the consciousness of the larger Self and he can only do it to some extent in exceptional conditions of his mentality or, more permanently and completely, as the fruit of a long and arduous self-training, self-deepening, self-heightening and self-expansion. His objective in life is to exist consciously in eternity, in the truth of the indivisibility of Time, in the indivisibility of Force and substance and not in the bondage of the hour and become a patient trustee of the slow eternal Time. The real truth of his being is a time-transcending eternity and living in the whole infinite course of triple Time, but not to a definite succession of moments and all the past, present and future are perfectly stored in every detail in the all-retaining integral Consciousness⁶ within him.
​
This second exclusive concentration, 'can neither live in the infinite time consciousness nor command any direct and real power of the triple time knowledge. The mind of ignorance (or second exclusive concentration) lives, not in the indivisible continuity of time, but successively in each moment. It has a vague sense of the continuity of self and of an essential continuity of experience, a sense of which the source is the deeper self within us, but as it does not live in that self, also it does not live in a true time continuity, but only uses this vague but still insistent awareness as a background, support and assurance in what would otherwise be to it a constant baseless flux of its being. In its practical action its only support other than its station in the present is the line left behind by the past and preserved in memory, the mass of impressions deposited by previous experience and, for the future, an assurance of the regularity of experience and a power of uncertain forecast founded partly upon repeated experience and well-founded inference and partly on imaginative construction and conjecture.'⁴⁴
​
Their Divine Will is to utilise time for the preparation of Divine descent, both during success and failure, happiness and sorrow, and opportunities and difficulties. A seeker of Truth utilises this second exclusive concentration towards calling down the Timeless Eternity to the slipping moments. The Synthesis of Yoga book proposes a Sadhaka to become ‘virginally creative at each moment.’³⁰ So through the practice of second exclusive concentration, the reception of brief Supramental touch is practicable.
“It (child Soul) can only near and touch, it cannot hold;” Savitri-179, (A developing Soul can receive brief Supramental touch.)
“There man can visit but there he cannot live.” Savitri-659 (all man can visit Supramental world for a brief period.)
​
c) Education through Third Exclusive Concentration:
​
“A heavenlier function with a finer mode
Lit with its grace man’s outward earthliness;
The soul’s experience of its deeper sheaths
No more slept drugged by Matter’s dominance.
…He lived in the mystic space where thought is born
And will is nursed by an ethereal Power
And fed on the white milk of the Eternal’s strengths
Till it grows into the likeness of a god.” Savitri-27-28
​
“He (Jijnasu) is a smallness trying to be great,
An animal with some instincts of a god, …
His hope a star above a cradle and grave.
And yet a greater destiny may be his,
For the eternal Spirit is his truth.” Savitri-78
​
“A pilgrim of the everlasting Truth,
Our measures cannot hold his measureless mind;
He has turned from the voices of the narrow realm
And left the little lane of human Time.” Savitri-80
​
“Where Space is a vast experiment of the soul,
In an immaterial substance linked to ours
In a deep oneness of all things that are,
The universe of the Unknown arose.” Savitri-95
​
“So must the dim being grow in light and force
And rise to his higher destiny at last,
Look up to God and round at the universe,
And learn by failure and progress by fall
And battle with environment and doom,
By suffering discover his deep soul
And by possession grow to his own vasts.” Savitri-146
​​
“Yet can the mind of man receive God’s light,
The force of man can be driven by God’s force,
Then is he a miracle doing miracles.” Savitri-457-458
​
“This is the little surface of man’s life.
He is this and he is all the universe;
He scales the Unseen, his depths dare the Abyss;
A whole mysterious world is locked within.
Unknown to himself he lives a hidden king
Behind rich tapestries in great secret rooms;
An epicure of the spirit’s unseen joys,
He lives on the sweet honey of solitude:” Savitri-479
​“A reasoning animal willed and planned and sought;
He stood erect among his brute compeers,
He built life new, measured the universe,
Opposed his fate and wrestled with unseen Powers,
Conquered and used the laws that rule the world,
And hoped to ride the heavens and reach the stars,
A master of his huge environment.
Now through Mind’s windows stares the demigod
Hidden behind the curtains of man’s soul: (Psychic being)
He has seen the Unknown, looked on Truth’s veilless face;
A ray has touched him from the eternal sun;
Motionless, voiceless in foreseeing depths,
He stands awake in Supernature’s light
And sees a glory of arisen wings
And sees the vast descending might of God.” Savitri-622
​
“Thus arises the attraction and, it would seem, the necessity of the principle of exclusive concentration which plays so prominent a part in the specialised schools of Yoga; for by that concentration we can arrive through an uncompromising renunciation of the world at an entire self-consecration to the One on whom we concentrate.”⁴
​Sri Aurobindo
“The effective fullness of our concentration on the one thing needful to the exclusion of all else will be the measure of our self-consecration to the One who is alone desirable. But this exclusiveness will in the end exclude nothing except the falsehood of our way of seeing the world and our will’s ignorance.”³⁴
​Sri Aurobindo
“A long, difﬁcult stage of constant effort, energism, austerity of the personal will, tapasya has ordinarily to be traversed before a more decisive stage can be reached in which a state of self-giving of all the being to the Supreme and the Supreme Nature can become total and absolute.”⁴⁷
​Sri Aurobindo
“A quietude and stillness is imposed on the body, on the active life-soul of desire and ego, on the external mind, while the sattwic nature by stress of meditation, by an exclusive concentration of adoration, by a will turned inward to the Supreme, strives to merge itself in the spirit.”¹⁴
Sri Aurobindo
“Do what I explained to you yesterday — make your brain work by studying regularly and systematically; then during the hours when you are not studying, your brain, having worked enough, will be able to rest and it will be possible for you to concentrate in the depths of your heart and ﬁnd there the psychic source; with it (finding of Psychic being) you will become conscious of both gratitude and true happiness.”³³
​The Mother
​
Concentration on subjective inner world by exclusion of concentration on the objective outer world and by exclusion of concentration on the present moment is identified as third exclusive concentration.
This world is identified as the outer body or sheath or Kosha of God. The Self that holds this outer body is known as the universal or cosmic Self. Behind this outer sheath there exist multiple subtle sheaths, mystic inner Spaces whose influence can purify, transform and perfect the external world. And then, the third exclusive concentration⁸ or reverse movement of first exclusive concentration,²² is defined as the complete absorption in the objective means or instruments of Education in finding the subjective Being or concentrates exclusively on the concealed inner being by quieting¹³ the frontal active prakriti and subjective experience of the ever-modified subtle mental states of its personality. This third exclusive concentration 'is conscious that the knowledge of all things is hidden within it or at least somewhere in the being, but as if veiled and forgotten, and the knowledge comes to it not as a thing acquired from outside, but always secretly there and now remembered and known at once to be true, — each thing in its own place, degree, manner and measure.'⁴⁵ Increase of third exclusive concentration gives birth to increase of consecration, which is identified as central truth of Integral Yoga. Thus we are able to link the central truth of integral Education with the central truth of Integral Yoga
Exclusive concentration on subliminal being might throw strong light on the large inner life and extend vastly the powers of human beings and it might lead towards an independent and radical Spiritual realisation but it would not be by itself an integral valid solution of truth of individual existence or lead us successfully to the integral knowledge of Reality which is something beyond the One and the Many, containing both and aware of both. The third exclusive concentration can be utilised further for unfolding the part knowledge of the Brahman.
(1) either through concentration of the One in itself to the exclusion of the Many; one can plunge by a trance of exclusive concentration into a mystic sleep²⁹ state by a subjective abolition of cosmic forces or pass abruptly in waking Mind into a state belonging to the supreme Superconscience
(2) or of the Many in their own action to the exclusion of the all-awareness of the One,
(3) or of the individual being absorbed in his own self to the exclusion of both of the One and the rest of the Many who are then to him separated units not included in his direct awareness,
(4) or again there may intervene all the above three separative active consciousness in a separative movement; but this takes place not in the true self, but in the active Prakriti. This third exclusive concentration is utilised to find the true physical being, true vital being, true mental being and the Psychic being.
​
d) Education through Fourth Exclusive Concentration:
​
“Only the Immortals on their deathless heights
Dwelling beyond the walls of Time and Space,
Masters of living, free from the bonds of Thought,
Who are overseers of Fate and Chance and Will” Savitri-53-54
​
“A voyager upon uncharted routes
Fronting the viewless danger of the Unknown,
Adventuring across enormous realms,
He broke into another Space and Time.” Savitri-91
​
“All ocean lived within a wandering drop,
A time-made body housed the Illimitable.” Savitri-101
​
“A little joy and knowledge satisfied
This little being tied into a knot
And hung on a bulge of its environment,
A little curve cut off in measureless Space,
A little span of life in all vast Time.” Savitri-148-149
​
“Almost she nears what never can be attained;
She shuts eternity into an hour
And fills a little soul with the Infinite;
The Immobile leans to the magic of her call;
She stands on a shore in the Illimitable,
Perceives the formless Dweller in all forms
And feels around her infinity’s embrace.” Savitri-177
​
“Unending Space was beaten into a curve,
Indivisible Time into small minutes cut,
The infinitesimal massed to keep secure
The mystery of the Formless cast into form.” Savitri-266-67
​
“A timeless Spirit was made the slave of the hours;
The Unbound was cast into a prison of birth
To make a world that Mind could grasp and rule.” Savitri-268
​
“There consciousness was a close and single weft;
The far and near were one in spirit-space,
The moments there were pregnant with all time.” Savitri-301
​
“Self’s vast spiritual silence occupies Space;
Only the Inconceivable is left,
Only the Nameless without space and time:” Savitri-310
​
“The splendid youth of Time has passed and failed;
Heavy and long are the years our labour counts” Savitri-345
​
“Time, life and death were passing incidents
Obstructing with their transient view her sight,
Her sight that must break through and liberate the god
Imprisoned in the visionless mortal man.
The inferior nature born into ignorance
Still took too large a place, it veiled her self
And must be pushed aside to find her soul.” Savitri-487
​
“She crossed through spaces of a secret self
And trod in passages of inner Time.” Savitri-490
​
“He is Eternity lured from hour to hour,
He is infinity in a little space:” Savitri-516
​
“Only when Eternity takes Time by the hand,
Only when infinity weds the finite’s thought,
Can man be free from himself and live with God.” Savitri-516
​
“In endless Time her soul reached a wide end,
The spaceless Vast became her spirit’s place.” Savitri-523
​
“The world is but a spark-burst from its light,
All moments flashes from its Timelessness,
All objects glimmerings of the Bodiless
That disappear from Mind when That is seen.” Savitri-548
​
“The infinite holds the finite in its arms,
Time travels towards revealed eternity.” Savitri-623
​
“A mute Delight regards Time’s countless works:
To house God’s joy in things Space gave wide room,
To house God’s joy in self our souls were born.” Savitri-630
​
“Time thrills to the sapphics of her amour-song
And Space fills with a white beatitude.” Savitri-632
​
“Is not the spirit immortal and absolved
Always, delivered from the grasp of Time?
Why came it down into the mortal’s Space?” Savitri-653
​
“He glimpses eternity, touches the infinite,
He meets the gods in great and sudden hours,
He feels the universe as his larger self,
Makes Space and Time his opportunity
To join the heights and depths of being in light,
In the heart’s cave speaks secretly with God.” Savitri-659
​
“By concentration upon the Idea the mental existence which at present we are breaks open the barrier of our mentality and arrives at the state of consciousness, the state of being, the state of power of conscious-being and bliss of conscious-being to which the Idea corresponds and of which it is the symbol, movement and rhythm. Concentration by the Idea is, then, only a means, a key to open to us the superconscient planes of our existence; a certain self-gathered state of our whole existence lifted into that superconscient truth, unity and infinity of self-aware, self-blissful existence is the aim and culmination; and that is the meaning we shall give to the term Samadhi.”³⁵
​Sri Aurobindo
​
“For our concentration on the Eternal will be consummated by the mind when we see constantly the Divine in itself and the Divine in ourselves, but also the Divine in all things and beings and happenings. It will be consummated by the heart when all emotion is summed up in the love of the Divine, — of the Divine in itself and for itself, but love too of the Divine in all its beings and powers and personalities and forms in the Universe. It will be consummated by the will when we feel and receive always the divine impulsion and accept that alone as our sole motive force; but this will mean that, having slain to the last rebellious straggler the wandering impulses of the egoistic nature, we have universalised ourselves and can accept with a constant happy acceptance the one divine working in all things. This is the ﬁrst fundamental siddhi of the integral Yoga.”³⁶
​Sri Aurobindo
​
This concentration is the outcome of the fusion of the above three¹⁷ exclusive concentrations. This is a concentration of separative active consciousness in a separative movement and this takes place not in true self, but in the untransformed active Prakriti. It does not prevent the full emergence and working of the whole conscious being behind the Ignorance, but a working in the conditions chosen and self-limited on nature for a special purpose. This power of self-limitation for a particular working, instead of being incompatible with the Integral Concentration, is precisely one of the powers we should expect to exist among the manifold energies of the Infinite. In this concentration, the present moment is utilised in linking the subjective Time with the objective Space or in this concentration self-concentration and self-expansion are reconciled. So, space and time are initially reconciled in the fourth exclusive concentration and finally in integral concentration.
​
e) Education through Essential Concentration:
​
“Absorbed no more in the moment-ridden flux
Where mind incessantly drifts as on a raft
Hurried from phenomenon to phenomenon,
He abode at rest in indivisible Time.
As if a story long written but acted now,
In his present he held his future and his past,
Felt in the seconds the uncounted years
And saw the hours like dots upon a page.” Savitri-33
​
“All we attempt in this imperfect world,
